*Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [日本語](README.ja.md)*

This utility can be used to easily update a version of eneblar-agent previously installed on Debian based systems with enebular-agent's install script to the lastest version available.

The updater itself is a Node.js application, but a bash script is also provided which allows updates to be run with just one step.
