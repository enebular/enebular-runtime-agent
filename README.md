# enebular-agent

_Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [日本語](README.ja.md)_

enebular-agent is Node.js based enebular IoT agent software for Linux gateways. enebular-agent works together with enebular to allow Node-RED flows to be deployed to and executed on the IoT device, and for the status of the IoT device to be reported back to enebular.

enebular-agent has the following key functionality.

- IoT device (agent) activation, registration and authentication.
- Management of a Node-RED instance, and deployment and execution of flows sent from enebular to that.
- Deployment and execution of files sent from enebular.
- Status and log reporting to enebular.
- Support for the enebular editor.

enebular communicates with enebular-agent via a third-party IoT platform connection.

## Features

### Registration and Authentication

To communicate with enebular, enebular-agent needs to receive its required device 'registration' information. enebular automatically sends this information to enebular-agent via the IoT platform connection.

enebular will also automatically update the enebular-agent's authentication information when required to allow it to use 'paid' device features (i.e logging and status reporting).

### Node-RED Flows

enebular-agent accepts flows deployed from enebular and manages a Node-RED instance to run them. It will also automatically install any published node modules that are depended on by the flow being deployed.

### File Deploys

enebular-agent installs files deployed from enebular. It supports the execution of those files and also running any command hooks that have been configured.

### Logging

enebular-agent will periodically send logged messages to enebular. It can also log to its own standard output streams (command-line console), but this is not enabled by default. To have it also log to the console, set the `DEBUG` environment variable. enebular-agent can also optionally log to syslog. See ’Configuration’ below for more information on configuration options.

enebular-agent captures and re-logs any messages that Node-RED logs to its standard output streams (stdout and stderr). This includes any messages from nodes in the flow being run which log to the console, like when the debug node is configured to log to the "debug tab and console". All messages captured from Node-RED are currently re-logged at the 'info' log level.

To view the logs on enebular, the device must be a 'paid' device.

### Status Reporting

enebular-agent provides simple reporting on its status to enebular (when it has been made a 'paid' device).

## Structure

enebular-agent is implemented as a collection of Node.js modules. Its core runtime functionality is implemented as the `enebular-runtime-agent` module (under the `agent` directory). On top of this, there is a module for each of the supported IoT platform connection types (under the `ports` directory). Each of the ports includes the enebular-runtime-agent core module as a dependency. See below for more information on the ports.

Node-RED is also installed as a Node.js module.

## Ports

A 'port' refers to the individual enebular-agent editions created to allow it to work with external connection services such as AWS IoT and Pelion Device Management.

To use enebular-agent you select the appropriate port for the IoT platform connection type you want to use, install and configure the port, and then run it using the executable under its `bin` directory.

The current ports are:

- **AWS IoT** - For use with AWS IoT
- **Pelion** - For use with Arm Pelion

## Using with enebular editor

To use enebular-agent with the enebular editor, enebular-agent must be started in developer mode by specifying the `--dev-mode` option. This option can be specified both when using the install script in the "Quick Setup" section and when starting enebular-agent manually.

## Updating

For information on updating enebular-agent to a newer version, please refer to the updater readme file.

- [Updater README](tools/updater/README.md)

## Quick Setup

You can quickly set up enebular-agent on a Debian based device (like a Raspberry Pi) by using the install script. The best way to use the script is by running it as a command with an ssh client on your development PC. To use the script you'll need to have the following.

- An ssh client command installed on your development PC
- The `sudo` command installed on your target device

You'll also need the following information about the target device.

- User login details (username and password)
- Current IP address

If you are using enebular-agent with AWS IoT and you'd like to automatically add a new _thing_ to use, you'll also need to know the following.

- Your AWS account access key ID
- Your AWS account secret access key
- Your AWS IoT region
- A name for the new _thing_

If you are using enebular-agent with Arm Pelion, you'll also need to have one of the following.

- Pelion developer credentials c file
- Pelion factory pal directory

### Basic Usage

The install script can be run on a remote device by using SSH on your development PC with the following command pattern.

```sh
ssh -t <user>@<device-ip-address> "wget -qO- https://enebular.com/agent-install | sudo -E bash -s"
```

This installs the AWS IoT enebular-agent port by default.

For example, to run the script on a remote Raspberry Pi with the default `pi` user and an IP address of `192.168.1.125`, the command would be as follows.

```sh
ssh -t pi@192.168.1.125 "wget -qO- https://enebular.com/agent-install | sudo -E bash -s"
```

To install a port other than AWS IoT specify the `--port` option. If installing the Pelion port, the command would be as follows.

```sh
ssh -t pi@192.168.1.125 "wget -qO- https://enebular.com/agent-install | sudo -E bash -s -- --port=pelion"
```

This will install enebular-agent, but as it will be missing the required connection info it will not actually run. If you'd like to automatically add a new AWS IoT _thing_ to use, then follow the instructions in the "Automatic AWS IoT Thing Creation and Setup" section below instead. If you're using the Pelion enebular-agent port and you'd like to install the required credentials, then follow the instructions in the "Pelion Credentials Install" section.

If you'd like to set up the connection info manually, you'll need to add the required files for the port (in the correct location and with the correct user permissions) as specified in the port's readme file and then restart enebular-agent. See the "Manual Setup" section further below for more details on this.

### Automatic AWS IoT Thing Creation and Setup

To install the AWS IoT enebular-agent port and also add a new AWS IoT _thing_ to use, the following four options must also be specified.

```
--aws-access-key-id=<Your AWS account access key ID>
--aws-secret-access-key=<Your AWS account secret access key>
--aws-iot-region=<Your AWS IoT region>
--aws-iot-thing-name=<A name for the new thing>
```

For example, to install the AWS IoT port and create an AWS IoT thing named `raspberry-pi` on a Raspberry Pi device (with the `pi` user and IP address of `192.168.1.125`), the command would be similar to the following.

```sh
ssh -t pi@192.168.1.125 "wget -qO- https://enebular.com/agent-install | sudo -E bash -s -- --aws-iot-thing-name=raspberry-pi --aws-access-key-id=<my-key-id> --aws-secret-access-key=<my-access-key> --aws-iot-region=<my-region>"
```

The install script requires access to the following AWS services.

- **IoT Core** - for adding the Thing and associated certificates, policies and rules

### Pelion Connection Mode Selection and Credentials Install

To install the Pelion enebular-agent port, the `--port` option must be set to `pelion`.

By default developer mode is selected for the connection mode. Factory mode can be selected by setting the `--mbed-cloud-mode` option to `factory`.

The required Pelion credentials must be copied to the device first and then their location specified with one of the two following options.

```sh
--mbed-cloud-dev-cred=<Path of the Pelion developer credentials c file>
--mbed-cloud-pal=<Path of the Pelion factory pal directory>
```

Use `--mbed-cloud-dev-cred` to specify the developer credentials in developer mode and `--mbed-cloud-pal` to specify the pal directory in factory mode.

For example, to install the Pelion port with developer credentials on a Raspberry Pi device (with the `pi` user and IP address of `192.168.1.125`), the commands would be similar to the following.

```sh
scp mbed_cloud_dev_credentials.c pi@192.168.1.125:/tmp/
ssh -t pi@192.168.1.125 "wget -qO- https://enebular.com/agent-install | sudo -E bash -s -- --port=pelion --mbed-cloud-dev-cred=/tmp/mbed_cloud_dev_credentials.c"
```

### Confirmation

Once the script has completed successfully, it will display a report similar to the following.

```
 enebular-agent has been successfully installed ✔
   - Version: <version>
   - Location: <directory>
   - User: enebular
   - Service name: enebular-agent-enebular

 enebular-agent is running as a system service.
 To check the status of agent, run the following command on the target device:
   sudo journalctl -ex -u enebular-agent-enebular.service
```

### More Details

For more information about other options the install script has, please refer to its readme file.

- [Install script README](tools/install/README.md)

## Manual Setup

The following describes how to set up enebular-agent manually (without using the install script).

### Installation

To run enebular-agent you need to install the Node.js modules required by the IoT platform port you want to use and also correctly configure the IoT platform's connection details.

The required modules and connection configuration differs for each IoT platform port. Please see the readme files of each port for details on how to set up and run the enebular-agent.

- [AWS IoT Port README](ports/awsiot/README.md)
- [Pelion Port README](ports/pelion/README.md)

### Configuration

enebular-agent supports a number of configuration options set via environment variables that are available no matter what IoT platform port is used. This includes the following.

- `DEBUG` - Have enebular-agent log to the console at the specified log level (i.e. `debug` or `info` etc). Note that if set to `debug` then debug messages will also be sent to enebular (when enebular-agent is authenticated).

- `NODE_RED_DIR` - The path of the installed Node-RED instance.

- `NODE_RED_DATA_DIR` - The path to use as Node-RED's working data (userDir) directory.

- `NODE_RED_COMMAND` - The command to use to start Node-RED.

- `ENEBULAR_CONFIG_PATH` - The path of the enebular-agent's main configuration file.

Each of the ports have additional configuration options. Please see the readme files of each port for details.

A full list of supported configuration options can be displayed by running the port's executable with the `list-config-items` subcommand, as shown below.

```sh
cd ports/<port>
./bin/enebular-<port>-agent list-config-items
```

For example, if using AWS IoT, then the command is as follows.

```sh
cd ports/awsiot
./bin/enebular-awsiot-agent list-config-items
```

### Startup Registration

enebular-agent has the ability to generate and register the configuration needed for it to be started up automatically at boot-time on Debian (systemd) based devices. This is done by running the port's executable with the `startup-register` subcommand and specifying an appropriate user (for enebular-agent to run as).

An example of using the `startup-register` subcommand and specifying `enebular` for the user when using the AWS IoT port is shown below.

```sh
cd ports/awsiot
./bin/enebular-awsiot-agent startup-register -u enebular
```

As with the `ENEBULAR_LOG_LEVEL` option in the following example, any extra configuration options that are specified will be captured and included in the startup configuration.

```sh
ENEBULAR_LOG_LEVEL=debug ./bin/enebular-awsiot-agent startup-register -u enebular
```

As registering the startup configuration requires root permissions, when the `startup-register` subcommand is run without root permissions it will not attempt the registration but instead display the correct full `sudo` command that should actually be run. Follow the instructions and run the full `sudo` command that is displayed.

### Confirmation

Once it's registered to start up automatically, you should be able to check the status of the enebular-agent with the systemd journal using the following command pattern.

```sh
sudo journalctl -ex -u enebular-agent-<user>.service
```

If the user was set to `enebular`, the command to use will be:

```sh
sudo journalctl -ex -u enebular-agent-enebular.service
```

To restart enebular-agent, use the following command.

```sh
sudo systemctl restart enebular-agent-enebular.service
```
